## Hi ! I'm Nate👋

I'm a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Tech who's passionate about nuclear energy and technology! 
I'm currently practicing my programming skills and learning more simulation tools for nuclear engineering purposes :)

## Skills (in progress)
- Programming: MATLAB, Python
- Tools: OpenMC, MOOSE
- Interests: Nuclear reactors, Computer simulation, and Sustainable energy

## Projects
* openmc-pwr-burnup: OpenMC Burnup Simulation for a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)
* openmc-pwr-full-fuel-assembly: OpenMC Simulation of a full fuel assembly (17x17) for a PWR
* openmc-mox: OpenMC simulation of a 2x1 core with one mixed-oxide fuel and one uo2 fuel
* openmc-mgxs: OpenMC project that generates multigroup cross section data for enriched uo2 fuel with three energy groups
